                           Database for keeping a record of Rented Vehicles.(Zoom Cars)

Objective:
In most of the tourist places we search for some one who gives vehicles for rent. So here we want to create a systematic and efficient database which will have a clear record of  
vehicle details such as price , petrol charges, how is the condition of the vehicle can we use it or not and till how much time we can use the vehicle etc . 

Discription:
Here is a business which  provides different vehicles on rent at different prices. The customer can get a vehicle on rent only after registering his name , id  and phone-number .Owner gives a fixed price for different vehicles and the price is distributed as per hours and days .The cost of petrol is also added in the list .One customer can take only one vehicle at a time.The person with an age above 22years can only register .So ,we should even include  date of birth as an attribute. To confirm registration the  customer should provide his Aadhar card number as an assurance(proof).

for example : The attributes for vehicle are type of the vehicle, vehicle_number, mileage, cost of petrol etc and the attributes for customer are customer_name, customer_id, DOB, Aadhar card number etc.


Following are sample queries, the system is expected to answer:

1) List all the customers who took more than 4 vehicles .
